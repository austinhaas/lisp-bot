*** setup dispatch system
    - separate processing from flow-control
    - processing will be handled by memoized functions
    - flow-control is handled by dispatch functions and an EXIT
      primitive
*** bind special variables in their own thread
    - we should be able to run multiple bots concurrently
*** add message relaying
